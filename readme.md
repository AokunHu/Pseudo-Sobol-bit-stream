Thank you for inquiring about our project. We have designed a pseudo-Sobol sequence for use in SC. It incurs a small loss in accuracy but offers higher hardware efficiency. Currently, we have open-sourced the simulation code for neural networks and Matlab simulation code. The simulation code for neural networks includes all necessary files and can be directly executed. The Matlab simulation code may still require some organization, and we plan to provide documentation in the future. We will continue to update and enhance the codebase with more open-source contributions.
